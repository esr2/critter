Stylistic errors are a symptom of poorly written code. Sadly, relatively few tools have implemented automated stylistic error checking and even fewer are customizable or written for C. CritTer (Critique from the Terminal) fills this void. It provides a tool to check for administrator-defined stylistic errors in C code. CritTer uses a SAX style of event-based programming to perform checks and produces warnings as the code is being read. Administrators can use predefined checks or create their own to enforce coding standards. Additionally, they can use CritTer to help grade and teach “good style” to students.
